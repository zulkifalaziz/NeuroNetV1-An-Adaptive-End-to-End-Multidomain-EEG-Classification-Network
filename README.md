# NeuroNetV1: A Unified End-to-End Framework for Multi-Condition EEG Classification

NeuroNetV1 is an advanced neural network designed for the classification of electroencephalogram (EEG) signals across multiple domains. This repository provides the implementation details, model architecture, and supplementary materials to facilitate understanding and utilization of the network.

## Repository Contents

- `Model/`: Contains the implementation of the NeuroNetV1 model.
- `Sample Data.rar`: A compressed file with sample EEG data for testing and experimentation.
- `Supplementary Document.pdf`: Provides supplementary results for the original manuscript
- `requirements.txt`: Lists the Python dependencies required to run the model.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python installed. It's recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies. You can install the required packages using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
